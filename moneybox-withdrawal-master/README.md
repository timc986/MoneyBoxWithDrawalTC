# Moneybox Money Withdrawal

The solution contains a .NET core library (Moneybox.App) which is structured into the following 3 folders:

* Domain - this contains the domain models for a user and an account, and a notification service.
* Features - this contains two operations, one which is implemented (transfer money) and another which isn't (withdraw money)
* DataAccess - this contains a repository for retrieving and saving an account (and the nested user it belongs to)

## The task

The task is to implement a money withdrawal in the WithdrawMoney.Execute(...) method in the features folder. For consistency, the logic should be the same as the TransferMoney.Execute(...) method i.e. notifications for low funds and exceptions where the operation is not possible. 

As part of this process however, you should look to refactor some of the code in the TransferMoney.Execute(...) method into the domain models, and make these models less susceptible to misuse. We're looking to make our domain models rich in behaviour and much more than just plain old objects, however we don't want any data persistance operations (i.e. data access repositories) to bleed into our domain. This should simplify the task of implementing WidthdrawMoney.Execute(...).
